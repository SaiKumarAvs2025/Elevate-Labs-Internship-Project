Cybersecurity Intern – Elevate Labs
Security Policy Creation & Cybersecurity Tools Implementation

Description:
As a Cybersecurity Intern at Elevate Labs, I developed and implemented a comprehensive security policy framework to enhance the organization’s security posture and mitigate potential cyber risks. The project focused on establishing structured security guidelines, access controls, incident response protocols, and best practices aligned with industry standards.

Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with critical cybersecurity tools and techniques, including:

Nessus: Performed vulnerability assessments to identify and prioritize security gaps.

Wireshark: Analyzed network traffic to detect potential threats and unauthorized activities.

Nmap: Conducted network scanning and port enumeration to assess system exposure.

Phishing Email Analysis: Identified phishing patterns and implemented preventive measures.

VPN Utilization: Configured and leveraged VPNs for secure remote access.

Browser Security: Applied security-focused browser extensions to minimize web-based attack vectors.

This internship strengthened my practical skills in cybersecurity risk management, threat analysis, and policy-driven defense strategies.
